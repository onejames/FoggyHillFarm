        <h3 className=" mt-4 text-3xl font-bold">How Long We Store Personal Data</h3>            
        <p className="my-3 ml-2 text-gray-500">User data will be stored until the purpose the data was collected for has been achieved.<br /><br />You will be notified if your data is kept for longer than this period.</p>

        <h3 className=" mt-4 text-3xl font-bold">How We Protect Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p className="my-3 ml-2 text-gray-500">In order to protect your security, we use the strongest available browser encryption and store all of our data on servers in secure facilities. All data is only accessible to our employees.<br /><br />
            While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>

        <h3 className=" mt-4 text-3xl font-bold">Children</h3>
        <p className="my-3 ml-2 text-gray-500">We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 years of age, the personal data will be deleted as soon as possible. If a child under 13 years of age has provided us with personal data their parent or guardian may contact our privacy officer.</p>

        <h3 className=" mt-4 text-3xl font-bold">How to Access, Modify, Delete, or Challenge the Data Collected</h3>            
        <p className="my-3 ml-2 text-gray-500">If you would like to know if we have collected your personal data, how we have used your personal data, if we have disclosed your personal data and to who we disclosed your personal data, or if you would like your data to be deleted or modified in any way, please contact us.</p>

        <p className="my-3 ml-2 text-gray-500">Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that you can set in certain web browsers. We do not track the users of our Site over time and across third party websites and therefore do not respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.</p>

        <h3 className=" mt-4 text-3xl font-bold">Modifications</h3>
        <p className="my-3 ml-2 text-gray-500">This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time in order to maintain compliance with the law and to reflect any changes to our data collection process.
